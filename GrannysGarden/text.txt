<p>This is the fifth cache that can be found whilst indulging in a bit of retro fun playing my version of the BBC Micro classic Granny's Garden.</p>
<p>Originally released in 1983, Granny's Garden was set in the magical Kingdom of the Mountains, where six children have gone missing. Using a variety of simple puzzles, players have to seek out and rescue each of them.</p>
<p>Where possible I've tried to replicate the puzzles as faithfully as possible, with one twist, in my version of Granny's garden you will need to use both your mental and physical abilities to succeed.</p>
<p>Visit the <a href="http://www.wherigo.com/cartridge/details.aspx?CGUID=26c7929e-53d1-44b4-b0cb-d3d83aa4cec2">Wherigo site</a> to download the cartridge and begin your adventure.</p>
<p>Not everyone will be able to find/access all caches however the cartridge who's puzzles where designed for 6- 10 year olds should be 'solveable' by all.</p>
<p>Failure at any given point in the original game would see you having to start again from the beginning,  however I've been kind and only require players to backtrack to the start of each activity.</p>

Please release all 5 caches in this series at the same time.
